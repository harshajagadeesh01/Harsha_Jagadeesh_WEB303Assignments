        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel
                factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his
                father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the
                north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian
                ancestry.</p>

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has
                known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas
                Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first
                confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a
                carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona-Espanyol derby.</p>
